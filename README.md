# Power BI – Cybersecurity Data Cleaning & Dashboard

This is a project I worked on for my Data Analytics unit. The goal was to clean and explore a raw cybersecurity dataset using Power BI and turn it into something that could help identify real security issues.

## What I did
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset using Power Query
- Handled missing data and fixed formatting issues
- Created new fields like Severity Rank, Browser, and Device Type
- Built several visualizations to highlight trends and threats

## Key Takeaways
- Older browsers (like Internet Explorer) showed more high-severity threats
- Even when alerts went down, anomaly scores stayed high
- DDoS and Intrusion attacks were the most common in the data

## Tools used
- Power BI
- Power Query
- Data cleaning techniques (transforms, splits, custom columns)
